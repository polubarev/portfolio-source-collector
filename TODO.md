# TODO

- Remove duplication in Binance positions when combining spot and Earn; ensure aggregation matches exchange-reported totals.
- (for human) Validate balances/positions output against real account data across all brokers; adjust parsing where discrepancies appear.
- Add to tinkoff positions like stocks and bonds and all other, not only currency
