# TODO

- Remove duplication in Binance positions when combining spot and Earn; ensure aggregation matches exchange-reported totals.
- Validate balances/positions output against real account data across all brokers; adjust parsing where discrepancies appear.
- Enrich Tinkoff positions with instrument identifiers (ticker/FIGI resolution) instead of generic FIGI/ instrumentType placeholders.
